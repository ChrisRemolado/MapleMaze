# MapleMaze
One of my first projects coded in Microsoft Visual Basic, I created various "escape the maze" type levels in increasing difficulty. I used a timer to create a sense of difficulty and spiced up later levels with:  -teleporters that would put you in a different section of the maze -coins that needed to be collected before completing the level -and levers!
